        The world is in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic. As WHO and partners work together on the response
         -- tracking the pandemic, advising on critical interventions, distributing  vital medical supplies
        to those in need--- they are racing to develop and deploy safe and effective vaccines. Vaccines save
            millions of lives each year. Vaccines work by training and preparing the body’s natural defences –                the immune system – to recognize and fight off the viruses and bacteria they target. After vaccination, 
           if the body is later exposed to those disease-causing germs, the body is immediately ready to destroy them, 
          preventing illness.As of 18 February 2021, at least seven different vaccines across three platforms have 
          been rolled out in countries. Vulnerable populations in all countries are the highest priority for vaccina
            tion.At the same time, more than 200 additional vaccine candidates are in development, of which more than
          60 are in clinical development. COVAX is part of the ACT Accelerator, which WHO launched with partners in 2020.
          COVAX, the vaccines pillar of ACT Accelerator, convened by CEPI, Gavi and WHO, aims to end the acute phase of 
          the COVID-19 pandemic by:
        
        *speeding up the development of safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19;
 *supporting the building of manufacturing capabilities; and
                        *working with governments and manufacturers to ensure fair and equitable allocation of the vaccines for all 
        countries – the only global initiative to do so.</pre>

          The vaccination registrations are expected to increase sharply 
          in view of India’s ambitious move to expand the inoculation 
            programme amidst the second wave of the pandemic.However, those
           aged 45 years and above will continue to enjoy  the on-site regis
         tration facility.
